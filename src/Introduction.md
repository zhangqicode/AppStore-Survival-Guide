######   Apps are changing the world, enriching people’s lives, and enabling developers like you to innovate like never before. As a result, the App Store has grown into an exciting and vibrant ecosystem for millions of developers and more than a billion users. Whether you are a first time developer or a large team of experienced programmers, we are excited that you are creating apps for the App Store and want to help you understand our guidelines so you can be confident your app will get through the review process quickly.

应用正在改变世界，丰富人们的生活，并且赋予了像你一样的开发者前所未有的革新能力。App Store已经成长为一个拥有几百万开发者和超过十亿用户的令人振奋而充满生机的生态系统。无论你是一个新手开发者还是一个大型团队中经验丰富的编程人员，我们很高兴你正在为App Store创建程序，并且我们希望帮助你理解我们的审核指南，以便你能够对自己的应用通过审核充满信心。

######	The guiding principle of the App Store is simple - we want to provide a safe experience for users to get apps and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful. We have updated the App Review Guidelines with that principle in mind. The guidelines themselves haven’t changed, but they are better organized and provide more context. On the following pages you will find guidelines arranged into five clear sections: Safety, Performance, Business, Design, and Legal. A few other points to keep in mind:

App Store的指导原则很简单 - 我们希望为用户获取应用提供安全的使用体验，为所有开发者提供优秀的成功机会。我们在更新应用的审核指南时已经考虑到了上述指导原则。这些指南自身并没有变化，它们被更精心的加以组织并提供的更多的内容。接下来你会发现审核指南被清晰的分为五个部分：安全，表现，业务，设计以及合法。还有一些事项你需要牢记：

######We have lots of kids downloading lots of apps. Parental controls work great to protect kids, but you have to do your part too. So know that we're keeping an eye out for the kids.

我们有大量的儿童用户在下载应用。家长控制机制很好的保护了孩子们，但是你也必须尽到义务。所以谨记我们对儿童有额外的关注。

######If your app looks like it was cobbled together in a few days, or you're trying to get your first practice app into the store to impress your friends, please brace yourself for rejection. We have lots of serious developers who don't want their quality apps to be surrounded by amateur hour.

如果你的应用看起来像是几天时间中粗制滥造的产物，或者你视图将开发练习的应用提交到store来取悦你的朋友，请做好被拒的准备。我们有大量严肃的开发者不希望他们高质量的应用被一堆业余产物包围。

######We will reject apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, "I'll know it when I see it". And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.

我们将拒绝任何我们认为其内容或行为越线的应用。你或许会问如何算越线，正如Supreme Court Justice曾说的：“I'll know it when I see it”，我们认为你应该清楚自己是否越线。

######If you attempt to cheat the system (for example, by trying to trick the review process, steal user data, copy another developer's work, or manipulate ratings) your apps will be removed from the store and you will be expelled from the Developer Program.

如果你试图欺骗系统（例如，干扰审核进程，偷窃用户数据，抄袭其它应用，或者人为干预评分系统），你的应用将会被下架，并且你将会被从开发者计划中除名。

######We hope these new guidelines help you sail through the App Review process, and that approvals and rejections are more consistent across the board. This is a living document; new apps presenting new questions may result in new rules at any time. Perhaps your app will trigger this. We love this stuff too, and honor what you do. We're really trying our best to create the best platform in the world for you to express your talents and make a living, too.

我们希望这些新的指南能够帮助你通过应用审核进程，通过和拒绝会一如既往的被公开。这是一份变动的文档，新的应用带来新的问题，新的问题导致新的审核规则。或许你的应用会触发这个过程，我们喜欢这个过程，并且尊重你所做的。我们竭尽全力为你创建世界上最好的平台，展示你的才华，以及为自己谋生。
